Game elements to add:
-More context sensitive hints for new mechanics?
-Paper clip cannot be used to pick filing cabinet, but can jam the lock of a business that's about to open.
-Gum can also be used to jam the lock of a business
    - I try the passenger door of the locksmith van. Ironically, it's open.
-When trying to lockpick public building on street: "I think people might notice if I pick the lock in broad daylight."

Exposition:
-Take bag from ceiling 
-Optionally take bag from toilet
-Newspaper on street
-Mention RICO in reference to case

Front Desk
Too well staffed to sneak out their notepad/computers
Paying too close attention to make your own keys, will have to find them elsewhere

Everett-Fitzgerald Hotel
-Executives want coffee
-Upon getting coffee, will give keys to occupied suite
-Sabotaged coffee will result in spill, drops expensive watch.
-Getting more coffee gets player in suite to look for more items
    -Pickpocket baggage claim ticket
        -Baggage claim ticket gives gym bag, entry to gym

Macau Grand

    - Possible to knock out/hit, choke, shoot (with pistol)

    - Call locksmith to make locksmith van appear

Three Oh Eight Columbus

-Bad guy set to testify against mafia bosses, gets taken out anyway
-Used to be a boxer, takes early morning jogs
-Dog appears in increasingly improbable locations
-On way back from hit, all gone

-Closed location passed several times, Animal Hospital. Nameplate has Albert Day, DVM

-Optional objective, take out bodyguard

-Final cutscene, see beta from afar, make eye contact. Uses PC's name, "Al" for the first time."That was the last time I ever really trusted anyone again."

I've taken contracts since then. Many, many contracts. But I always turned them down if the target didn't suit my interests. That's a luxury that having a day job affords me. Most people would say that what I do isn't right. But I'm careful, selective. Make sure I know who they really are.

A small group of joggers, possibly triathlon trainees, run past with the singleminded determination of a pack of malamutes pulling a sled.

- Change description of Central Park location after the climax of the story to include badguy shot

-Even money says a merger/acquisition or a lawsuit.

- Two names on the animal hospital sign, one male, one female
- As a result, the janitor in the bathroom also needs to be ambiguously gendered. Need to avoid all pronouns.


Random things to add:
-Broken mirror in the Public Bathroom.
-I peel off a few twenties and pay for the dozen coffees.
-Place ceiling tile on floor by default

-Locker room has a combination lock that can be opened with locksmith infos?
-TODO: Make disposable container class that disappears when empty.
-It's loaded with one bullet. It's all I usually need.

-To the east, I can see a large glass building in the shape of a cube.
